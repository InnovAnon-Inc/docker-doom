          Changelog for the ZDaemon 1.10 -> 1.11 transition
          =================================================

1. Point 01 release (2018-03-15)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Significant improvements to unlagged; hitting in online mode should
    now be exactly the same as in SP mode even in very high ping
    situations; furthermore, there should be far fewer "dropped shots".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Point 02 release (2018-04-08)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Added a new dmflag (DF3_INFINITE_ITEMS = 4) and an associated CVAR
    (sv_infiniteitems). It blocks the "consumption" of an item when it
    is used (so it's effectively infinite once you acquire it).

 2. Changed the behavior of callvote: the person that calls the vote
    is automatically marked for a "yes" vote, so there is no need for
    them to issue such a command separately.

 3. Implemented a new "duel" mode (gametype=9). It differs from normal
    DM in the following aspects:
      a. maxplayers is forced to 2.
      b. overtime is forced to 1.
      c. sv_deathlimit is constrained from 15 to 60.
      d. When 2 players join, they start in "warmup" mode where they
         can play, get a feeling about the server, shoot and damage
         each others, but the frag/death/suicide counters remain at
         zero. When they are ready to start the game, they can call
         a vote with the command "callvote game". The vote requires
         100% agreement to pass.
      e. Once the "set game" starts, it will end in one of 3 ways:
           * Someone wins/loses (normal end of game).
           * Someone disconnects (automatic forfeiture of the game
             no matter the disconnection reason).
           * The players can use "callvote cancel" to cancel the
             game. If the vote passes, the game is canceled, no
             stats are recorded and it returns to warmup mode.
      f. If demo recording is enabled on the server, it will record
         demos only for the actual game: not the warmup.
      g. The warmup period length can be constrained by the
         "warmup_timelimit" CVAR; it defaults to 5 minutes and
         can range from 0 (which means unlimited) up to 1000.

 4. Fixed stretched skies in widescreen mode.

 5. World and global ACS arrays are now zero-initialized as they
    should be.

 6. An attempt to load a map will now only happen if a valid
    sequence of properly named data lumps follows its label.

 7. Extended tab autocompletion for client console commands. Auto-
    completion after "toggle", "rcon" and "rcon toggle" is possible.

 8. Fixed Heretic ammo pickup. Values for all types of ammo are 
    correct now.

 9. Fixed client freeze (eg. iddqd1.wad map12, whitemar.wad map01).

10. Fixed a problem that would cause spectators to reveal secrets
    under certain conditions.

    get_player_redflag, get_player_blueflag, get_player_greenflag,
    get_player_whiteflag.
    They return the player id or displayplayer if there is no value.
    In combination with spy or spec_follow it's possible to bind a
    shortcut for spectating (e.g. bind x "spy $get_player_maxfrags").

 7. Fix for mapinfo keywords 'noinfighting', 'normalinfighting',
    'totalinfighting' and 'clipmidtextures'.

 8. Mapinfo 'keepfullinventory' added.

    was executed by a player and set to an actor during a
    team based game their client would crash upon opening the automap.

12. Fix for client command 'idmypos', coordinates were not
    displayed when changing view to actor cameras.

13. Mapinfo ignores episode and skill definitions now ('episode',
    'clearepisodes', 'skill', 'clearskills').
    Ignored map keywords: 'bordertexture', 'strictmonsteractivation',
    'laxmonsteractivation', 'missileshootersactivateimpactlines',
    'missilesactivateimpactlines', 'monsterfallingdamage',
    'teamdamage', 'allowrespawn', 'teamplayoff', 'teamplayon',
    'noinventorybar', 'infiniteflightpowerup', 'f1',
    'checkswitchrange', 'nocheckswitchrange', 'translator',
    'unfreezesingleplayerconversations'.

    they will enable timestamps in both the log (when enabled) and
    console respectively.

15. Console command 'give all' now also gives you Artifacts and
    Puzzle items when the corresponding inventory graphics are 
    present.

16. DeHackEd: "Ammo type ZD" has been added in order to get around
    a legacy zdoom 1.23 holdover with "Ammo type" value of 5 being
    hard-coded for infinite ammo. Infinite ammo in "Ammo type ZD" is
    now a value of -1 and below, while 0 and above are for the
    standard weapons. This ensures legacy behaviour is preserved
    when it comes to "Ammo type". The new "Ammo type ZD" ensures
    that all of the ammo types are accessible.

17. The 'idmypos' display will no longer overlap with the 'netstats'
    or other items.

18. Players and voodoo dolls did not trigger line specials when they
    spawned and their center was exactly on a line. Fixed.

19. Implementation of DeHackEd thing property: 'Camera height',
    This property allows for each actor to have it's own camera 
    height, it accepts both whole and decimal numbers.

    'PlayWeaponSound', 'CPA_CustomMissile', 'CPW_CustomMissile',
    'CPA_BulletAttack', 'CPW_BulletAttack', 'CPA_CustomBulletAttack'
    and 'CPW_CustomBulletAttack' by using keyword 'Sound name ZD'.

21. Added support for the following string properties to the
    GetActorProperty ACS function:

      * APROP_SeeSound
      * APROP_AttackSound
      * APROP_PainSound
      * APROP_DeathSound
      * APROP_ActiveSound

    NOTE: The returned string values will only have a lifetime of 1
          tick for now.

22. Added the following ZDoom ACS functions returning strings:

      * GetActorClass
      * GetActorFloorTexture
      * GetActorFloorTerrain
      * GetCVarString
      * StrLeft
      * StrMid
      * StrRight
      * GetWeapon

    NOTE: The returned string values will only have a lifetime of 1
          tick for now.

    types are supported at the moment:

      * ARMORINFO_CLASSNAME
      * ARMORINFO_SAVEAMOUNT
      * ARMORINFO_SAVEPERCENT

    NOTE: The string value returned for ARMORINFO_CLASSNAME will only
          have a lifetime of 1 tick for now.

24. Extended the puke and pukename console commands to accept various
    input format specifiers (these correlate to the ACS Print function
    cast types). The full synopsis of the two commands is now as
    follows:

      puke <number> [[?:]val1] [[?:]val2] [[?:]val3]
      pukename <name> [always] [[?:]val1] [[?:]val2] [[?:]val3]

    Where ? can be replaced by one of the following letters which will
    determine how the value will be parsed (unless otherwise specified,
    the script will receive the input value converted to an integer):

      * b: binary number
      * c: character
      * d: decimal number
      * f: real number
             (the script will receive a fixed-point number)
      * i: decimal number
      * l: key from the LANGUAGE lump
             (the script will receive the looked up string)
      * n: PRINTNAME_* constant
             (the script will receive the respective fetched string)
      * s: string
             (the script will receive the string as is)
      * x: hexadecimal number

    If no format specifier is present in front of a value, the commands
    will behave as they did until now, and the value will be parsed as
    a decimal number and the script will receive it as an integer.

    CVAR substitution is supported when using a format specifier; i.e.
    the following will work:

      pukename script_name s:$cvar_name

    For the purpose of quoting, the whole argument, including the
    format specifier, needs to be inside the quotes given that format
    specifiers are an addition specific to the puke commands and that
    standard command line parsing happens before the format specifier
    parsing; i.e. the following WILL work:

      pukename script_name "s:String with spaces."

    The following WILL NOT work:

      pukename script_name s:"String with spaces."

    NOTE: The strings received by the scripts will only have a lifetime
          of 1 tick for now.

25. Added missing Hexen skill names to the PCD_PRINTNAME ACS opcode
    (the n:PRINTNAME_SKILL argument of the ACS Print function).

26. DeHackEd: Powered weapon frames that are triggered by the
    "Tome of Power" can now be altered, added and modified through
    Dehacked for every weapon by adding the following entries within a 
    weapon block; 'Powered select frame ZD', 
    'Powered deselect frame ZD', 'Powered bobbing frame ZD',
    'Powered shooting frame ZD' and 'Powered firing frame ZD'.
